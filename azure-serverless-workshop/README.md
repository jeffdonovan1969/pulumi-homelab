## Azure Serverless Workshop with Pulumi

This hands-on workshop will walk you through various tasks of managing Azure infrastructure with the focus on serverless compute and managed Azure services. All the resources are provisioned with [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) in the infrastructure-as-code fashion.

You will be building an end-to-end Drone Delivery application that is based on two [reference architectures](https://github.com/mspnp/serverless-reference-implementation) defined by Microsoft.
